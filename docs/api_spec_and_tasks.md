## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
pygame==2.0.1
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required in other languages.
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No API spec required as this is a standalone game application.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("constants.py", "Contains all the constant values used in the game such as window size, colors, etc."),
    ("food.py", "Implements the Food class which includes the spawn method for creating food in the game."),
    ("snake.py", "Implements the Snake class which includes methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking for collisions."),
    ("game.py", "Implements the Game class which controls the game flow, including starting, pausing, resuming, and ending the game, as well as increasing the game difficulty."),
    ("main.py", "Main entry point of the application. Creates a game instance and starts the game loop.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "constants.py",
    "food.py",
    "snake.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'constants.py' contains all the constant values used in the game such as window size, colors, etc. These values should be defined first as they will be used in other modules.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear point at the moment. However, we need to ensure that Pygame library is properly installed and initialized before starting the game development.

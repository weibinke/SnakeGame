## Implementation approach
We will use Pygame, a popular open-source Python library for making games, to implement the snake game. The game will be designed in an object-oriented manner with separate classes for the game, snake, and food. The game mechanics will be implemented first, followed by the user interface, scoring system, and additional features. The game will be made more difficult by increasing the speed of the snake as the score increases. The pause/resume feature will be implemented using Pygame's event handling system.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game_pygame"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "constants.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        +int score
        +bool game_over
        +bool paused
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
        +pause_game()
        +resume_game()
        +increase_difficulty()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +str direction
        +move()
        +grow()
        +check_collision()
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +spawn()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: create game
    G->>S: create snake
    G->>F: create food
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move snake
        S->>S: check collision
        alt collision with food
            S->>G: increase score
            G->>F: spawn new food
            G->>S: grow snake
            G->>G: increase difficulty
        else collision with self or wall
            G->>G: end game
        end
        alt game paused
            G->>G: pause game
            G->>G: resume game
        end
    end
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
